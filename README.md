# Ombori React Code Test

This is a web version of [React Native Code Test](https://github.com/ombori/react-native-code-test])

It was created using create-react-app. It includes basic logic, components and CSS. I commented some places I would normally code differently.

## Usage
`yarn start` starts the app.
